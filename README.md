# SET

### Project Overview:
This is a browser-based recreation of the card game [SET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(card_game)). Though one could probably find a way to play this with multiple people, the "Rules and Instructions" page and overall design were created with the assumption there would be a single player.

### Project Purpose:
This is my very first "side-project" in my journey to learn how to code/program. I only started my first coding lessons a few months before creating this. I was looking for a game that I could recreate, and a friend recommended *SET* because he thought that the logic for finding a SET on the board would pose an interesting challenge. I had actually never heard of the game before starting this project!

### Running the App:
This app is already deployed on GitHub Pages. You can also use [this link](https://dane-leblanc.github.io/SET/) to play the game.

Enjoy!
